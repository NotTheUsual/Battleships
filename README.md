# Battleships

This was meant to be a group exercise (with Colin, Abraham and Roy) to create a playable version of battleships. Unfortunately, it's only playable over telnet, and we were never able to try it out, as we didn't manage to finish in time.

Still, it's mostly functional. you can initialise a board with a Player, and then populate it with a random arrangment of ships. Players (initialised with a board) can shoot at an opponent's board, and the board can register those shots. It can generate the player's view and the opponent's view (ie only the results of the shots they've made). Finally, as is good and right, a Player knows when it's been beaten.
